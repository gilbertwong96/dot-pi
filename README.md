# dot-pi

A curated Pi package with extensions, skills, prompt shortcuts, and rules.

## Install

Install Pi first:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Then install this package:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/dannote/dot-pi
```

For the recommended end-user setup, run the bootstrap script. Safer review-first flow:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannote/dot-pi/master/install.sh
less install.sh
sh install.sh
```

Convenience one-liner:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannote/dot-pi/master/install.sh | sh
```

The bootstrap is a POSIX `sh` script for macOS, Linux, and WSL. It installs Pi if missing, installs dot-pi with `pi install`, offers `agent-browser`, and explains optional companion packages (`pi-elixir`, `pi-subagents`, `pi-context`, and `pi-computer-use` on macOS) before prompting. `pi-elixir` defaults to yes when Elixir or Mix is detected; other companions default to no.

Headless/non-interactive Linux needs Node.js 22.19.0+ and npm available before Pi can install. Check with `node --version` and `npm --version`; install Node 22+ with your preferred Node manager or distro setup if needed.

Use non-interactive defaults with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannote/dot-pi/master/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes
```

Useful bootstrap options:

```bash
sh install.sh --help
sh install.sh --local              # install dot-pi into the current project
sh install.sh --with-companions    # install all optional companion packages
sh install.sh --no-agent-browser   # skip agent-browser setup
sh install.sh --dry-run            # print commands without running them
DOT_PI_REF=v0.2.1 sh install.sh    # install a specific release/tag
```

Project-local install for a repo/team:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/dannote/dot-pi -l
```

Start Pi and use `pi config` to review or change what is enabled:

```bash
pi config
```

Update Pi and installed packages later with:

```bash
pi update
```

If prompt shortcuts such as `/ga` or `/verify` do not appear, check that `dot-pi` is enabled in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": ["git:github.com/dannote/dot-pi"]
}
```

Global prompt templates are discovered from `~/.pi/agent/prompts/*.md`; project prompt templates are discovered from `.pi/prompts/*.md` after the project is trusted. For a manual checkout instead of `pi install`, symlink the prompt files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/prompts
ln -s /path/to/dot-pi/prompts/*.md ~/.pi/agent/prompts/
```

Useful companion packages, installed separately when you want them:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use@v0.2.6  # macOS computer use
pi install npm:pi-elixir                                    # Elixir/BEAM development
pi install npm:pi-subagents                                 # subagent delegation
pi install npm:pi-context                                   # context history tags/checkouts
```

`pi-computer-use` is especially useful for visible macOS apps. It adds semantic window/screenshot tools and prefers Accessibility refs over coordinates.

`pi-elixir` is recommended for Elixir/Phoenix work. It adds a small BEAM-native tool surface (`elixir_eval`, AST search/replace) so Pi can inspect and change running Mix projects through the Elixir runtime instead of shelling out for everything.

Recommended external Gmail skill/tool setup:

```bash
# Google Workspace CLI with generated agent skills
# Repo: https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli
# Note: the repo says it is not an officially supported Google product.
npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli

tmp=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$tmp"
gws generate-skills
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/skills
cp -R skills/gws-shared skills/gws-gmail* ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

`gws generate-skills` creates many Workspace skills, not just Gmail. Copy only `gws-shared` and `gws-gmail*` if you want email without Drive/Calendar/Admin/etc. noise. This package's confirmation rules ask before Gmail write actions such as send, reply, forward, modify, trash, or delete.

## What is enabled by default

The default install focuses on broadly useful, low-surprise tools.

Slash command priority can be configured in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "slashCommandPriority": [
    "ga",
    "gaa",
    "lgtm",
    "quote",
    "next",
    "oracle",
    "recap",
    "all",
    "nobc",
    "verify",
    "retry",
    "push",
    "release",
    "ar"
  ]
}
```

Project settings append after user settings. The extension only changes autocomplete order; commands still come from normal Pi prompt/extension/skill discovery.

Action confirmations use shell-style argv parsing, not regex matching. Defaults cover publishing/editing GitHub/GitLab issues, PRs/MRs, comments, reviews, GitHub repo/release mutations, mutating `gh api` calls, Gmail writes via `gws gmail`, X/Twitter mutations via `bird`, git pushes/risky git actions, package publishing, releases, and common deploy CLIs. Tune groups or add local rules in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `.pi/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "confirmActionGroups": {
    "github": true,
    "gitlab": true,
    "git": true,
    "gmail": true,
    "twitter": true,
    "publish": true,
    "deploy": true
  },
  "confirmCommands": [
    { "argv": ["gh", "release", "create"], "label": "Publish GitHub release" },
    { "command": "railway up", "label": "Deploy with Railway" }
  ]
}
```

Set a group to `false` to disable those built-in confirmations; custom `confirmCommands` still append after enabled defaults.

### Workflow slash commands

These mirror my actual repeated Pi prompts from recent coding sessions, so I can type less without losing intent. Most are prompt shortcuts; `/next`, `/recap`, and `/quote` are extension commands so optional arguments and selection handling stay clean.

My usual coding flow:

1. Ask `/next` when context gets fuzzy. Pi should restate state, list the next concrete steps, and pick the best immediate move.
2. Use `/ga` for a simple approval of the current path. This is the direct replacement for my very frequent “go ahead”.
3. Select assistant text, press `ctrl+/`, then comment below the inserted email-style quote.
4. Use `/lgtm` when I want more autonomy than `/ga`: proceed, implement the next slice, verify, and summarize.
5. Use `/oracle` when I want an expensive model to answer from a compressed context instead of dumping the full session into it.
6. Use `/recap` when `/next` is too local and I need the original plan vs current drift.
7. Use `/all` after reviews/plans when I do not want piecemeal fixes.
8. Use `/verify` when I suspect the agent skipped tests, browser checks, CI, or manual validation.
9. Use `/retry` after a failed/flaky attempt, usually with a tighter diagnosis.
10. Use `/push` once the work is coherent; use `/release` only when changelog/version/publish prep is needed.
11. Use `/ar` for the repeated autoresearch resume loop after context-limit restarts.

| Command          | Use when I would normally type...           | Meaning                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/ga`            | `go ahead`                                  | Minimal approval; continue current path.                                                                                       |
| `/gaa`           | `go ahead with all`                         | Alias for `/all`; complete all pending review/plan items, not one-by-one.                                                      |
| `/lgtm`          | `yes`, `do it`, `okay`                      | Proceed; do not ask unless blocked; verify and summarize.                                                                      |
| `/quote [text]`  | selected assistant excerpt + comment        | Quote args or current selection as `>` lines. Shortcut: `ctrl+/`; `/quote` without args may use clipboard as a final fallback. |
| `/next [count]`  | `whats next?`, `what are next 7 big steps?` | Brief state, prioritized next steps, best immediate action.                                                                    |
| `/recap [focus]` | `wtf is going on?`, `what was the plan?`    | Reconstruct global context: goal, state, decisions, open threads, drift, and best action.                                      |
| `/oracle [q]`    | `ask the expensive model`                   | Opens a native picker/confirm flow, pre-compacts, reduces one-turn context, switches model, answers, then restores.            |
| `/ar`            | `autoresearch loop ended... resume`         | Resume experiment loop from saved state; run and log next experiment.                                                          |
| `/verify`        | `did you test?`, `use browser`, `run ci`    | Run relevant checks, fix failures, rerun focused checks.                                                                       |
| `/all`           | `fix all`, `do all`, `all pending items`    | Same intent as `/gaa`; complete all pending review/plan items, not one-by-one.                                                 |
| `/nobc`          | `no backward compatibility for new stuff`   | Replace newly introduced names/config cleanly; keep compatibility only for real released users.                                |
| `/push`          | `push`, `commit and push`, `time to commit` | Review status, commit in repo style, push.                                                                                     |
| `/release`       | `publish`, `changelog`, `prepare release`   | Prepare release artifacts/checks; do not publish without confirmation.                                                         |
| `/retry`         | `retry`, `try again`, `rerun`               | Diagnose previous failure, retry tighter, verify.                                                                              |

Configure `/oracle` in settings:

```jsonc
{
  "oracle": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    "thinking": "high",
    "precompact": {
      "enabled": true,
      "mode": "pi",
      "keepRecentTokens": 4000,
      "minTokens": 1000,
      "reserveTokens": 12000
    },
    "context": {
      "maxTokens": 12000,
      "summary": "latest",
      "keepTailTokens": 3000,
      "keepUserTurns": 3,
      "keepAssistantTurns": 2,
      "drop": {
        "thinking": true,
        "toolResults": "all",
        "toolCalls": "names-only",
        "bashOutput": "truncate",
        "images": true,
        "customMessages": true
      }
    },
    "tools": "none",
    "confirm": true,
    "defaultIntent": "verify",
    "pricing": { "inputPerMillion": 10, "outputPerMillion": 50 },
    "budget": { "targetOutputTokens": 1500, "maxTotalUsd": 1 }
  }
}
```

Run `/oracle` without args for the native intent picker and cost/context confirmation. Run `/oracle <question>` to skip the intent picker but still preview before sending. `precompact.mode` can be `"pi"`, `"custom"`, or `"off"`. Custom mode uses `precompact.model` when set and `precompact.thinking`; the final one-turn context is still reduced by the `context` policy without deleting session history.

### Skills

| Skill                     | Description                                                                                                                               | Extra setup                                             |

## Optional resources

These are included in the repo but not enabled by default because they are experimental, personal, platform-specific, or require extra credentials.

Enable them by replacing the package entry in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` with an object-form package filter. Use `+path` to opt into resources outside the default manifest.

### Optional extensions

`coach.ts` is the optional extension I recommend to newcomers: it explains the setup, habits, and first workflows. `tutor.ts` gives an in-place Dan-style workflow hint when the user is stuck or drifting. Try one from a local checkout with:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/dot-pi/extensions/coach.ts
```

| Extension              | Why optional                                                                      |

`voice-input/` uses `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `rec` from sox. Optional environment variables: `ELEVENLABS_LANGUAGE`, `ELEVENLABS_KEYTERMS` (comma/newline-separated), `ELEVENLABS_COMMIT_STRATEGY` (`manual` or `vad`), `ELEVENLABS_VAD_SILENCE_THRESHOLD_SECS`, `ELEVENLABS_VAD_THRESHOLD`, `ELEVENLABS_MIN_SPEECH_DURATION_MS`, and `ELEVENLABS_MIN_SILENCE_DURATION_MS`.

### Optional skills

Regular optional skills live under `skills/`. Extra/meta skills live under `skills/extra/` so they do not look like core setup features.

| Skill             | Why optional                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Extra skills

| Skill              | Why extra                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dont-anger-mario` | Meta etiquette for drafting concise pi issues/contribution proposals |

Example package filter enabling only voice input, AppleScript, and the extra Mario etiquette skill:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/dannote/dot-pi",
      "extensions": ["+extensions/voice-input"],
      "skills": [
        "+skills/applescript",
        "+skills/session-reflect",
        "+skills/extra/dont-anger-mario"
      ],
      "prompts": ["prompts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules

Rules are intentionally not enabled through the package. They are personal preference files. Symlink the ones you want into `~/.pi/agent/rules/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/rules
ln -s /path/to/dot-pi/rules/typescript.md ~/.pi/agent/rules/
```

| Rule                        | Description                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `backward-compatibility.md` | Avoid unnecessary compatibility shims               |
| `bun.md`                    | Use Bun instead of Node.js/npm                      |
| `comments.md`               | Avoid redundant comments                            |
| `commit-messages.md`        | Follow existing repo commit style                   |
| `delete-files.md`           | Use `rm -f` to delete files                         |
| `git-hosting.md`            | Use `gh`/`glab` CLI instead of fetching URLs        |
| `pull-requests.md`          | PR workflow: study templates, preview before submit |
| `ripgrep.md`                | Prefer `rg` over `grep`                             |
| `skills-cli.md`             | Run skill commands from skill directory             |
